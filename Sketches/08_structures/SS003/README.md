# {Software} Structure 003
- a surface filled with one hundred medium to small sized circles. each circle has a different size and direction, but moves at the same slow rate. display:
  1. the instantaneous intersections of the circles
  2. the aggregate intersections of the circles 

1. the points moving on the screen are the center of each circle and the lines connect the intersections on the perimeters of overlapping circles. to emphasize the difference in line length, they increase in value from white to black as they grow longer. because the edge of a circle is a nonlinear surface, the lines drawn from the intersections begin to grow quickly, linger as they approach maximum length, and diminish quickly. When three or more circles overlap, the illusion of depth increases as the resulting lines construct a corner. 

2. the aggregate version is like photographing the instantaneous version with the shutter left open for an extended time. it gives a different vision into the structure by compressing changes over time into the same visual space. the transition of the line values from white to black is critical to avoid that the screen saturates entirely with one value. the image created by this software is continually changing and never repeating.
